Instead, we'll use the data in the [avax-tweets-dataset](https://github.com/gmuric/avax-tweets-dataset) -- described in the \"[COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy on Social Media: Building a Public Twitter Dataset of Anti-vaccine Content, Vaccine Misinformation and Conspiracies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05134)\" paper. Since this collection (and there may be a temporaly component), we may also use the [COVID-19 Tweets](https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs) corpus, which maintains an ongoing collection. This latter corpus only has the tweet IDs, not the actual tweets. We need to download this data.\n",

    "In this POC example, I filtered for any tweets with negative sentiment using VADER in NLTK. I think it is fine to use valence for the POC. However, in the Misinformation project, we want tweets which produce the \"discrete emotion\" of fear around vaccines for those who read the tweet. There are existing approaches to finding discrete emotions, including in the paper \"[Joint Discrete and Continuous Emotion Prediction Using Ensemble and End-to-End Approaches](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3242972).\"\n",

We should use the same keywords if we pull in data from the \"COVID-19 Tweets\" corpus. If we do not use these keywords, one potentially important missing part of this step is finding misinformation. (It's not good enough to find a tweet like, \"I hate covid\" because we don't care about someone's opinions per se. Instead, we'll want to get tweets similar to \"With #COVID19, all the toilet paper in the supermarket will be gone.\" In other words, we want tweets expressing statements which we can test for veracity... regargless of whether they are true or false.)\n",
