listen covid19 is no joke plus with the acc rules they would have to sit out at least two games if they get covid19 i know unfortunately because covid19 is not a joke that clemson and nd players will catch it after that storm at least one of these teams will end up losing
i dont see clemson losing another game unless covid19 hits them i see nd playing unc and possibly losing to them if nd gets hit with covid19 that storm on the field was not smart
shit nd and clemson may not even make it to the acccg if covid19 hits them smh if covid19 hits them and any of their best players end up being out because of it that could lead to one if not both of them losing again before the acccg that storm on the field was not smart
